# steam-hours-plotly
A simple flask.py website which implements plotly to display a users steam hours given their steam64id in a bar chart view.

The website will not function properly until the "key" line within app.py is changed to your personal steam api key and the "steam64id_hardcode"
line is changed to whichever steam64id you wish to plot the hours for.

To initialise the website please follow the steps found here:
http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/

Issues:
-Steam64ID has to be hardcoded
